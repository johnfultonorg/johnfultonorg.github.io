      24FA, 25SP, 25SU<br>
      Capstone
      <p>Description: This course, the final one in the Master of Science - Computer Science program, challenges
        students to research a current topic of interest in Computer Science and produce an original paper and
        presentation on the topic. In addition to the research paper, students are introduced to the economics of
        software development and the tools needed to estimate the cost of a software development project for management
        in a corporate environment. The last topic in the course is a discussion of ethics as it relates to Information
        Technology. Current topics in ethics will be discussed through the use of relevant case studies. The recitation
        portion of this course focuses on job preperation and career development.</p>

      24SU, 25SU<br>
      Cybersecurity for the Professions
      <p>Description: This course is a breadth-based cybersecurity course for non-technical majors. It aims to equip a
        bachelorâ€™s degree seeker with no prior cybersecurity knowledge, other than what the newspaper reports say, with
        essential cybersecurity knowledge. The course introduces organizational, people, and technological aspects of
        cybersecurity. More specifically, it covers (1) governance, standards, and risk management topics in the
        organizational domain, (2) security awareness, privacy, ethics and cyber threats in the people domain, and (3)
        cyberspace, critical sectors, and emerging topics in the technological domain.</p>

      24FA<br>
      Information Assurance
      <p>Description: This course covers the fundamentals of security in the enterprise environment. Included are
        coverage of risks and vulnerabilities, threat modeling, policy formation, controls and protection methods,
        encryption and authentication technologies, network security, cryptography, personnel and physical security
        issues, as well as ethical and legal issues. This foundational course serves as an introduction to many of the
        subsequent topics discussed in depth in later security courses. Note, this course has proctored exam(s). This
        exam requires additional technology, if student uses online proctoring.</p>
