        Grange Insurance as a
        Lead Programmer Analyst where he designed and developed a variety of .Net-based systems that interact with the
        company's agents and
        policyholders. In addition to a Bachelor's and Master’s degree in computer science, John has a masters degree in
        Cybersecurity. He
        taught Computer Science for over 10 years as an adjunct faculty member at Franklin University. In 2016, he spent
        a month teaching

      <p class="paragraph">John has always been the “go to” guy when others needed an explanation for technical topics.
        In addition to his
        time teaching beginner programming students at Franklin University, John has acted an a mentor and resource for
        many programmers and
