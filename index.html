          John has spent over 35 years as a professional developer, programming
          on a wide variety of systems from large mainframe computers to desktop
          computers and web-based systems. His most recent experience was 17
          years at Grange Insurance as a Senior Programmer Analyst where he
          designed and developed a variety of .Net-based systems that interact
          with the company's agents and policyholders. In addition to a
          Bachelor's and Master’s degree in computer science, John has a masters
          degree in Cybersecurity. He taught Computer Science for over 10 years
          as an adjunct faculty member at Franklin University. In 2016, he spent
          a month teaching computer algorithms as a visiting scholar at a
          college in Muscat, Oman.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          After 7 years as an instructor in a coding bootcamp, in May of 2024,
          John joined Franklin University as a full-time faculty member,
          teaching in Computing Sciences and Mathematics,
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          John is the first-named inventor of two patents for a user interface
          for banking, bill paying, and shopping. He has acted as an expert
          witness and consultant in several court cases concerning banking
          technology.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          John lives in Bexley with his wife, their dog, and two cats. He has 4
          adult children who are spread between Columbus and Atlanta and two
          granddaughters.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          John has always been the “go to” guy when others needed an explanation
          for technical topics. In addition to his time teaching beginner
          programming students at Franklin University and at a coding bootcamp,
          John has acted as a mentor and resource for many programmers and
          people who wanted to become programmers. A committed tinker, his
          workbench is packed with the small robots that he builds and programs
          in his spare time.
