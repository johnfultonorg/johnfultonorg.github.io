      <h2>Some STEM Merit Badges</h2>
      <br>
      <h3 class="heading-1"> Artificial Inteligience</h3>
      <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/artificial-intelligence/"
          target="_blank">https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/artificial-intelligence/</a></p>
      <p>The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Merit Badge introduces Scouts to the fundamentals of AI and automation through
        hands-on activities and real-world examples. Scouts learn key terms, explore how AI and automation are used in
        daily life, school, and work, and examine ethical concerns like bias and privacy. They also investigate
        deepfakes, practice communicating effectively with AI, and apply their knowledge through a project or teaching
        activity. Finally, Scouts explore career paths in AI by researching or interviewing professionals in the field.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="heading-1"> Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/cybersecurity/"
          target="_blank">https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/cybersecurity/</a></p>
      <p>The Cybersecurity Merit Badge equips Scouts with essential knowledge and skills to navigate and protect the
        digital world. Scouts learn about online safety, ethical behavior, cyber threats, and how to defend against them
        using tools like firewalls, antivirus software, and strong passwords. They explore encryption, connected
        devices, and the risks of public Wi-Fi, while also practicing safe habits like updating software and backing up
        data. Through hands-on activities, Scouts investigate real-world cyber incidents, participate in cybersecurity
        challenges, and explore career opportunities in the field.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="heading-1"> Digital Technology</h3>
      <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/digital-technology/"
          target="_blank">https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/digital-technology/</a></p>
      <p>Comprehend how electronic devices work and how to use them effectively with the Digital Technology Merit Badge.
        Scouts will give a brief history of the changes in digital technology and discuss how technology today compares
        with the technology available to previous generations—all while imagining what kinds of devices might be
        available to them in the future.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="heading-1"> Electronics</h3>
      <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/electronics/"
          target="_blank">https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/electronics/</a></p>
      <p>The Electronics Merit Badge is a fun, STEM-based merit badge that will inspire Scouts to pursue a possible
        career in Electronics. Scouts will learn about capacitors, transistors, and resistors while grasping the basic
        principles of digital techniques and demonstrating how to build a control device circuit. Understand the
        behaviors of electrons and learn safety precautions when using, building, altering, or repairing electronic
        devices with the Electronics Merit Badge.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 class="heading-1"> Programming</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/programming/"
            target="_blank">https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/programming/</a></p>
        <p>Programming merit badge will take you “behind the screen” for a look at the complex codes that make digital
          devices useful and fun.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 class="heading-1"> Radio</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/radio/"
            target="_blank">https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/radio/</a></p>
        <p>Radio is a way to send information, or communications, from one place to another. Broadcasting includes both
          one-way radio (a person hears the information but can¹t reply) as well as two-way radio (where the same person
          can both receive and send messages).</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="heading-1"> Robotics</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/robotics/"
            target="_blank">https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/robotics/</a></p>
        <p>Build your own working robot with the Robotics Merit Badge. Learn about the robotics industry, discover the
          different fields of robotics, explore the available career options in robotics, and design, build, program and
          test your own robot.</p>
