      <h2>Some STEM Merit Badges</h2>
      <br>
      <h3 class="heading-1"> Artificial Inteligience</h3>
      <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/artificial-intelligence/"
          target="_blank">https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/artificial-intelligence/</a></p>
      <p>The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Merit Badge introduces Scouts to the fundamentals of AI and automation through
        hands-on activities and real-world examples. Scouts learn key terms, explore how AI and automation are used in
        daily life, school, and work, and examine ethical concerns like bias and privacy. They also investigate
        deepfakes, practice communicating effectively with AI, and apply their knowledge through a project or teaching
        activity. Finally, Scouts explore career paths in AI by researching or interviewing professionals in the field.

      <p>The Cybersecurity Merit Badge equips Scouts with essential knowledge and skills to navigate and protect the
        digital world. Scouts learn about online safety, ethical behavior, cyber threats, and how to defend against them
        using tools like firewalls, antivirus software, and strong passwords. They explore encryption, connected
        devices, and the risks of public Wi-Fi, while also practicing safe habits like updating software and backing up
        data. Through hands-on activities, Scouts investigate real-world cyber incidents, participate in cybersecurity
        challenges, and explore career opportunities in the field.</p>

      <p>The Electronics Merit Badge is a fun, STEM-based merit badge that will inspire Scouts to pursue a possible
        career in Electronics. Scouts will learn about capacitors, transistors, and resistors while grasping the basic
        principles of digital techniques and demonstrating how to build a control device circuit. Understand the
        behaviors of electrons and learn safety precautions when using, building, altering, or repairing electronic
        devices with the Electronics Merit Badge.</p>
